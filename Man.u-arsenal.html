                Final Score: Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal 
                Goal: Riccardo Calafiori scored in the 13th minute with a header from a Declan Rice corner. 
                Set-Piece Strength: Arsenal have been especially effective from corners—since the start of the 2023-24 season, they have scored 31 Premier League goals from corners, at least 11 more than any other team. In that period, Man United have conceded 23 goals from corners—more than any other team.

            <p style="color:white;">
                United dominated much of the ball: they had around 60-62% possession and took 22 shots compared to Arsenal’s 9. 
                Despite that dominance, United struggled to create high-quality chances. Their expected goals (xG) were modest, and they hit the post (Patrick Dorgu) and had other chances from new signings (Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo) that were saved or cleared. 
                Arsenal, on the other hand, defended solidly, held on despite United’s pressure, and David Raya made several important saves to preserve the clean sheet.

            <p style="color:white;">
                Arsenal’s ability to grind out tight wins away from home (especially via set pieces) was evident again.
                United showed promising signs in attack (good possession, shots) but were let down by finishing and perhaps some defensive lapses (especially on set-pieces).
                The result reinforced a pattern: Arsenal often win at Old Trafford by 1-0. This was their sixth Premier League away win over Manchester United, and in all six cases the score was 1-0.
