            <p> In a dramatic Premier League game on August 30, 2025, Manchester United edged Burnley 3–2 thanks to a 97th-minute penalty from Bruno Fernandes after VAR intervened on a foul by Jaidon Anthony on Amad Diallo. 
                United had taken the lead in the first half via a Josh Cullen own goal (off a Casemiro header that hit the bar) and had ≈61.8% possession while Burnley had ≈38.2%.               Burnley struck back early in the second half via Lyle Foster, but United responded almost immediately through Bryan Mbeumo (his first Premier League goal for the club) Manchester United. Burnley equalized again through Jaidon Anthony, capitalizing on a spill by United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir. United had 26 shot attempts to Burnley’s 6, and 7 corners to Burnley’s 1. The win gave United their first league victory of the season and came after pressure following a humiliating midweek Cup exit.</p>
