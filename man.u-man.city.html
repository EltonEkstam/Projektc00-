            <p style="color: white;">Manchester City ran out 3-0 winners over Manchester United at the Etihad. Phil Foden struck first in the 18th minute, heading in Jérémy Doku’s cross. After the break, Erling Haaland showed his clinical edge, scoring twice within 15 minutes. His first came via a delicate chip on 53 minutes, before adding a second from Bernardo Silva’s through ball on 68. The derby again showcased City’s attacking stars in decisive form.</p>

            <p style="color: white;">The opening half saw just five shots combined, the lowest in a Manchester derby since 2015, but City’s efficiency proved decisive. Remarkably, 15 of City’s last 17 league goals against United have been scored by Foden (7) or Haaland (8). New signing Gianluigi Donnarumma impressed with a key save from Bryan Mbeumo, sealing a clean sheet. United’s struggles under Ruben Amorim continued, as his side’s tally stands at just 31 points in 31 league games.</p>
